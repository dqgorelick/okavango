## Questions (in order of priority)

- how do we confirm things are working once the system is deployed? what is the "backend" the system is sending data to? 
- for each weather station memory card do I edit `FK.CFG` so `R6 ROCKBLOCK` -> `CT ROCKBLOCK`
- how do we confirm validity of data the sensors are collecting? Should we assume they are calibrated properly? 
- for sonar / water depth sensor, how do we calibrate it? Should we record the height between the water surface level and the sensor? 
- does temperature sensor need any sort of calibration?
