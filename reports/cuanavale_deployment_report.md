# Deployment Report

4/19/17 â€“ deploying environmental sensor at Cuanavale Source

## Deconstructing existing station

- Condition of weather and sonar looked good. Spider webs were gathering in the sonar sensor
- Noticed weather solar panel was pointing south
- Moved sonar sensor rod from current location further south (upstream), and used it to deploy new atlas water sensors

## Deploying new station

- Reused existing weather station to install new sensor, passed pre-flight
- Installed water sensors upstream from current location, still in the outflow area. Returned the following day with a non-rbber mallet to plant the rods further into the river-bed
