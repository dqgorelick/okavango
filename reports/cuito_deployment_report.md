# Deployment Report

4/13/17 – deploying environmental sensor at Cuito Source

- Arrived at 10:43 local time

## Deconstructing existing station

Weather:

- External condition of Weather – excellent, tripod and weather station look good too
- Internal condition of Weather – a wasp made a home there, LEDs still blinking, lots of wires / breadboards
- other comments: The sonal was pointing due south, which is not ideal based on the position of the sun. Also, only one pike was placed on each foot of the tripod. The tripod did not blow away so seems fine.

Sonar:

- External condition of Sonar - okay, a spider laid eggs / started making a nest on the sonar sensor (this may cause issues with measurements)
- Internal condition of Sonar – seems to be operational

## Deploying new station

##### Location of Weather (5M accuracy):

- Latitude: -12.70455
- Longitude: 18.35429

##### Location of Sonar / Atlas (5M accuracy):  

- Latitude: -12.70464
- Longitude: 18.35422

##### Deploying weather:

- deployment went well. Reused the existing tripod and weather station.

##### Deploying Atlas:

- Reused the stake which was being used by the Sonar from last year. The probes were left to run with the current, creating a 45º angle between the rod and the sensor wires.
- Case was hard to close, but deployment went well otherwise.

##### Deploying Sonar:

- Planted the new stake (~.75" diameter steel rod) into the bed of the river next to the existing rod from the previous year.
- The existing rod left the sensor only about 0.5meters above the water. Used the new pole to allow more clearence.
- refer to photos for final setup.
- actual distance was not measured, but from photos distance can be calculated from known height of pelican case in photo

##### Photos will be stored on the harddrive

4/14/17 - switching out RockBlocks, new serial number: 11380
