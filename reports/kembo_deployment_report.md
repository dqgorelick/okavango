# Deployment Report

## Deploying new station

- Weather feather passed pre-flight. Pointing solar-panel north.
- Access was limited to the actual outflow, so water sensors are placed on north bank of the lake.
- Vegetation (long grasses) may cause issues for solar panels in the future, but were not blocking in this case.

##### Where to find sensors:

- Placed weather station where camp site would be (folks at camp will know where this is).
