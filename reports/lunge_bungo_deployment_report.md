rod# Deployment Report

4/27/17 & 4/28/17 â€“ deploying environmental sensor at Lunge Bungo source lake (Tchanssengwe)


### First Day:

- Arrived at 3:40pm local time
- Surveyed area and constructed weather station. Before powering on noticed one of the Rockblock cables had come undone. Decided to bring back the Rockblock to finish deploying the next day.
- Realized lake was too deep (and floor too soft) even at the edges. Decided to attach two steel rods together for extra height
- Solar panel is pointing due-north, as well as the marking on the wind vane.

### Second Day:

- Fixed RockBlock at camp, installed on weather station. Feather passed the pre-flight after 1 min or so glowing red.
- Installed water sensors by securing the steel rod to a tree trunk (using duct-tape) in addition to planting it into the bed. Two rods were hose clamped together to provide more height. The sonar is directly over water ~1.25m above the surface
- Sonar mounting bracket had to be bent and attached the opposite way to the pelican. An extra screw-hole / screw were added. Attached using two hose-clamps and duct-tape
- Sonar does not have ideal orientation, is horizontal, and in the shade of the tree-trunk for a part of the day.
- Water sensor attached to steel rod at an angle using only one hose-clamp and duct-tape. Solar panel orientation is not ideal, is pointing West.

##### Location of Weather (5M accuracy):

- Latitude: -12.41818
- Longitude: 18.64838
- RockBlock IMEI = 300234065112330, Code = 11372

##### Location of Sonar / Atlas (5M accuracy):  

- Latitude: -12.41772
- Longitude: 18.64774

### Finding the sensors

- I would recommend walking on the north bank, or using a boat to paddle to the outlet. Heading towards the outlet the water sensors should (hopefully still) be visible about 20 meters from the actual outflow grasses.
- The weather sensor is north of the water sensors up on the ridge. At the location of the water sensor, climb up the ridge and walk north-east towards the clearing in the trees. The weather station should be visible within 2 minutes of walking.
