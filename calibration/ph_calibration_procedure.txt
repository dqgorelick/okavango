Calibrating the pH

- clean vessels using the storage fluid, wait for each to dry
- fill vessels with 4.00, 7.00, 10.00 solutions
- remove probe from storage fluid
- look for air bubble, and remove bubble by gently shaking the probe
- rinse probe with filtered lake water
- start calibration program
- submerge probe into 7.00 solution
- wait 2-4 minutes
- hit enter on `cal,mid,7.00>` prompt
- rinse probe, submerge in 4.00 solution, wait 2-4 minutes
- hit enter on `cal,low,4.00>` prompt
- rinse probe, submerge in 10.00 solution, wait 2-4 minutes
- hit enter on `cal,high,10.00>` prompt
- hit enter until we get to `r>` prompt
- while probe is still in 10.00 solution, record reading
